 🌐 IoT Sensor Data Monitoring Dashboard

 📌 Project Overview
This project is an IoT-based data monitoring system that simulates sensor data and visualizes it using a Python dashboard. It demonstrates how real-time sensor data can be generated, stored, analyzed, and monitored effectively.

The project focuses on understanding IoT data flow and basic data analysis rather than hardware-level implementation.



 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- CSV data handling
- Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab)
- Data visualization libraries


📂 Project Structure
IoT_sensor/
├── dashboard.py # Dashboard for visualizing sensor data
├── simulate_sensors.py # Script to simulate IoT sensor readings
├── live_sensor_data.csv # Generated sensor data
├── iot_sensor_data_analysis.ipynb # Data analysis done using Google Colab


⚙️ How It Works
1. Sensor data is simulated using `simulate_sensors.py`
2. The generated data is stored in a CSV file
3. Data analysis and exploration are done using Google Colab
4. The dashboard reads the CSV file and displays sensor insights


🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:https://github.com/Shalinips/iot-sensor-dashboard.git
2.Navigate to the project folder: cd IoT_sensor
3.Run the sensor simulation: python simulate_sensors.py
4.Run the dashboard: python dashboard.py
